# SSR vs SSG in Next.js

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) are two popular rendering strategies in Next.js. Let's understand the difference between them:

```tsx
// pages/index.js
import React from "react";
const IndexPage = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Server-Side Rendering (SSR)</h1>
      <p>{data}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

SSR is a rendering strategy where the server generates the HTML for each request. When a user visits a page, the server fetches the data, renders the HTML, and sends it to the client. This allows search engines to crawl and index the content effectively. SSR is useful for dynamic content that needs to be personalized for each request.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

SSG is a rendering strategy where the HTML pages are pre-generated during the build process. The server generates the HTML for all the pages in advance, and the generated HTML is then served to the client. This approach improves performance as the pages are already built and can be cached by CDNs. SSG is suitable for content that doesn't change frequently, such as blog posts or documentation.
